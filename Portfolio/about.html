    <div class="intro1"><p>Hello! I'm Kunal Kumar, a passionate student currently pursuing a B.Tech. in Computer Science from Lovely Professional University. Technology has always fascinated me, igniting my curiosity to explore its endless possibilities. From coding algorithms to designing user interfaces, I find joy in every aspect of the digital realm.

        Outside of academics, I'm an avid problem-solver and creative thinker. Whether it's brainstorming new project ideas or collaborating with peers, I thrive in environments that encourage innovation and teamwork. I'm also deeply involved in ConverseE+ where I've had the opportunity to develop leadership skills and make meaningful contributions.
        
        Through my portfolio, I aim to showcase not only my technical skills but also my passion for learning and growth. I'm excited about the journey ahead and the opportunity to make a positive impact through technology. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!
